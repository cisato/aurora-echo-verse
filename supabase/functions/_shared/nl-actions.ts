// Natural-language actions.
//
// Aurora on Telegram has no slash commands. Everything a command used to do —
// saving, forgetting, listing memory, switching mode, voice replies, check-ins,
// linking a web account, starting a fresh thread — is recognised from ordinary
// conversation by a small, fast classifier, executed deterministically, and
// then handed to the conversational model as a factual note so the reply reads
// like a person, not a receipt.
//
// The rule that matters: the classifier never writes the reply, and the
// conversational model never performs the action. Aurora only says "saved"
// because a row was actually written.

Actions:
- "save_memory" — they EXPLICITLY asked it to remember/save/note something. value = the thing to remember, written as a standalone sentence. (Casual mentions of facts are NOT this — background extraction handles those.)
- "forget_memory" — they explicitly asked it to forget/delete/erase something stored. value = the key words to match.
- "list_memory" — they asked what it remembers / knows about them / what's stored.
- "set_mode" — they asked it to behave differently in a lasting way. option = one of: assistant, growth_partner, therapist_lite, strategic, casual, creative, technical.
- "voice_pref" — they asked about how it replies with audio. option = "off" (text only), "on" (voice back only when they send voice), "always" (voice every reply).
- "checkins" — they asked it to message them first, stop messaging first, or change how often. option = "on", "off", or a digit 0-5 for a daily cap.
- "link_account" — they want to connect this chat to their Aurora web account. value = the code if one appears in the message, else empty.
- "new_thread" — they asked to start over / fresh conversation / clear the chat context.
- "unlink" — they asked to disconnect this chat entirely.
- "none" — anything else, including questions about these features rather than requests to change them.

Be conservative. If unsure, return "none".`;
